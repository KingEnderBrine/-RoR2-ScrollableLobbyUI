# Description
Adds scrolling to skills overview, loadout and characters select. Mainly used by [ExtraSkillSlots](https://thunderstore.io/package/KingEnderBrine/ExtraSkillSlots/)

# Future
* Add horizontal scrolling to individual loadout rows. This will allow developers to add much more skills/skins, because you will be able to select them.

# Bugs
Feel free to ping me on discord `@KingEnderBrine` if you found one.
